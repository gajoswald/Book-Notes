### It's All Just Bits
> If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an indivudal may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possess the less, because every other possess the whole of it.
